# COPIA
> Copia is a management application developed for ConcipioTektura, currently COPIA runs on 2 platform. Android and desktop, however the desktop version is currently under development and requires a lot of refactoring. This application makes it easier for ConcipioTektura apprentices to manage the company's client information. It can also manage users where administrators can change their positions, lists down all apprentices, accept pending requests, and delete pending requests.
